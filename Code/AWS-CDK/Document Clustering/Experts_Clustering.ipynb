This fix is behind the following feature flag:\n\n    @aws-cdk/aws-codepipeline:crossAccountKeyAliasStackSafeResourceName\n\nFixes issue #18828.\n\n*By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license*\nfix(codepipeline): cannot deploy pipeline stack with crossAccountKeys twice (under feature flag)","_deepnote_index_column":"5"},{"0":"----\nConverting from a type to itself would not check the integral flag and simply return the current duration amount rather than throwing an error if the amount converted to was fractional.\n\nCommands such as `toSeconds()` or `toMinutes()` had the same behavior since they leverage `convert()`.\n\n`Duration.minutes(0.5).toMinutes();` previously would not throw an error, but `Duration.seconds(30).toMinutes();` would. \n`Duration.minutes(0.5).toMinutes();` will now throw an error while `Duration.minutes(0.5).toMinutes({ integral: false});` will not.\n\nfix(@aws-cdk/aws-events/schedule.ts): `rate()` now correctly catches if a duration is defined in fractions of a minute. The root cause was the use of `Duration.toMinutes()` in `rate()`. Now all rates defined with durations must be in whole minutes.\n\ndocs: this limitation on rates is highlighted more clearly in the documentation for aws-events/schedule.ts and aws-events/rule.ts. \n\nThis closes #17814.\n\n### All Submissions:\n\n* [x] Have you followe…","_deepnote_index_column":"6"},{"0":"See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/merge-back/1.160.0/CHANGELOG.md)chore(merge-back): 1.160.0","_deepnote_index_column":"7"},{"0":"See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/merge-back/2.28.0/CHANGELOG.md)chore(merge-back): 2.28.0","_deepnote_index_column":"8"},{"0":"See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/bump/1.160.0/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n-------------------------\n\n## [1.160.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/compare/v1.159.0...v1.160.0) (2022-06-14)\n\n\n### ⚠  Removal of Node 12\n\n- Starting with this release, Node 12 is no longer supported and customers should upgrade to Node 14, 16, or 18.\n\n### Features\n\n* **cfnspec:** cloudformation spec v75.0.0 ([#20615](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/20615)) ([0a13e09](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/0a13e09af6299afed031c4c1814f621e4dd8e975))\n\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* **lambda:** deprecate Python3.6 ([#19988](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/19988)) ([9602229](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/9602229b6c9105fc4c0ade3348d0c250a2f39c6d)), closes [#20085](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/20085)\n\n\n### Miscellaneous Chores\n\n* **deps:** npm-check-updates && yarn upgrade  ([#20684](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/20684)) ([e661fe9](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/commit/e661fe9fa8c4978ea…","_deepnote_index_column":"9"}]},"text/plain":"                                                       0\n0      Historically, policy statement deduplicating w...\n1      See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk...\n2      Patch release to resolve https://github.com/aw...\n3      fixes #8406 \\n\\n----\\n\\n### All Submissions:\\n...\n4      Please add your +1 👍 to let us know you have e...\n...                                                  ...\n11802  Initial implementation for #6 -
